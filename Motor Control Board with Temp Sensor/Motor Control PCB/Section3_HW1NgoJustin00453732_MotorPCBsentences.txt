I decided to put two red LEDs on the incoming power (VCC and 6V+) so that I can see that the board is at least getting power. Each coming input has a capacitor to smooth out noise that isn't exactly a pure DC source. Given the constrain in the bill of materials (BOM) and from professor recommendation. 0.1 uF were the best choice to use. I didn't use the 1uF because it was very big but may decide to use it on the DC Motor input so that noise emitted will not interfere with the input line. For the sense resistor I didn't want anything too big that will affect the power line and so the smallest resistor availabe in the BOM was 0.04 ohms which is perfect as it doesn't affect the total (6v) too much.
